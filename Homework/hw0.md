function that takes parameters
for loop

**(1)** Write a function **onOff()** that takes two arguments. The function should make the LED turn on and off and delay. The arguments represent the two delay times. [Hint: we've already written this function in class].

**(2)** Write a new function, **slowClap()** that uses a **for loop** and the **onOff()** function. Each time through the loop the LED should should blink 3 times, and with each iteration the LED should blink noticeably faster. Do 10 iterations.



Blink clock
Blinks every second
Double blinks every minute
Triple blinks every hour

Loop
Every second(ish), blink an increasing number of times up to 10
Every second(ish), blink 5 times at an increasing rate (slow clap- in class)

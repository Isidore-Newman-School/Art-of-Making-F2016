# Computer Sound

This doc will walk you through the process of triggering sounds on a computer using an Arduino.

1. Begin by installing [Processing](http://processing.org/) - a visual programming language that works well with Arduino.

2. Next, upload the correct Arduino program. The most basic example is ```Arduino > sendNote > "sendNote.ino"```
If you're using a Capacitive Touch Sensor, you may want to look at the cap_sendNote.ino example.

3. After modifying and uploading the correct Arduino program, open ```SoundPlayer > SoundPlayer.pde``` in Processing.

4. Select the Serial port on which your Arduino is currently running.


Voila!

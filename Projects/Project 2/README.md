# Project 2 - ROBOlympics


## OVERVIEW
Students will work in teams to build autonomous Arduino robots that will compete in the ROBOlympics, a series of robotics challenges. Groups will employ the engineering design process and demonstrate Arduino programming proficiency as they attempt to earn medals in up to six different events.

## REQUIREMENTS
Each team must compete in at least two events.
Each student must write at least one Arduino program.
Each group must 3D model and print at least one original (not from the internet) chassis, mascot, attachment, or other robotic part.


## EVENTS
* **Shot Put** - robots must launch a ping pong ball as far as they can.
* **Obstacle Course** - robots must get to the finish line as fast as possible without running into obstacles. If the robot touches an obstacle, it is moved to the starting point.
Race and Stop - robots must get as close to the finish line as possible, in the shortest amount of time, without crossing the line. Crossing the line disqualifies the robot.
* **Ping Pong Pickup** - robots must retrieve ping pong balls from enemy territory and return them to base. The robot with the most balls before the timer runs out wins.
* **Capture the Flag** - robots must retrieve flags (rings) and return them to base. The robot with the most flags in base when the timer runs out is the winner.
* **Style Competition** - the robot with the best body design (laser cutting, 3D printing, Neopixels, ...) wins. Style Competition cannot count towards the 2 event requirement.


## SCORING
Teams may win medals- gold (3pts), silver (2pts), or bronze (1pt) in any particular event.
The team with the most points at the end of ROBOlympics receives 5 bonus points on Project 2.


## EVALUATION
The following criteria are used to evaluate creative assignments:
* **Meets Requirements**: Does the project follow directions and fulfill all aspects of the assignment? Are materials turned in on time?
* **Code**: To what extent is your code free of bugs? To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)? To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?
* **Craftsmanship**: To what extent is your project well-designed, well-executed, and functioning properly?
* **Creativity**: To what extent is the project unique, inventive, and imaginative?
* **Effort**: Is there evidence that you invested time and energy in the project?


## PLAGIARISM
In the age of the internet, and particularly in the realm of computer programming, it is very easy to copy someone else’s work.

#### Code
Sharing code and building off of previous work is permissible, and even encouraged, so long as:
* The code is open source.
* You give proper credit by including a comment in your code with a URL or clear description of the source code. Credit is also required for “adapted” code.
* The copied/adapted code cannot make up a substantial portion of the project.


#### Instructables
If you find a project online that you’d like to replicate, think about how you can make it your own. Using online projects for inspiration is permissible; copying projects directly is not. Talk to Ms. deBB if you have any questions.

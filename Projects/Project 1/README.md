# Project 1. Electronic Music Instruments

Students will work in groups of 2-3 students to develop innovative, Arduino-controlled electronic music instruments. Electronic xylophones, musical gloves, and laser harps are just a few examples of potential projects. Thanks to the large variety of sensors (force, light, flex, sound, etc.), there are infinite possibilities for generating sound with Arduinos.

## Requirements
Musical Instrument
* Sound triggered human interaction
* LED(s)

At least one instance of the following components must be used in your code:
* Variable
* conditional logic (if/else)
* Loop
* Array
* Uniquely defined function that takes an argument

## Grade
* 40% - Code
* 30% - Musical Instrument Circuit
* 20% - Engineering Lab Report
* 10% - Presentation

## Evaluation
The following criteria are used to evaluate creative assignments:
* **Meets Requirements**: Does the project follow directions and fulfill all aspects of the assignment? Are materials turned in on time?
* **Code**: To what extent is your code free of bugs? To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)? To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?
* **Craftsmanship**: To what extent is your musical instrument presentable, well-designed, and functioning properly?
* **Creativity**: To what extent is the project unique, inventive, and imaginative?
Effort: Is there evidence that you invested time and energy in the project?

##Plagiarism
In the age of the internet, and particularly in the realm of computer programming, it is very easy to copy someone else’s work.

**Code**  
Sharing code and building off of previous work is permissible, and even encouraged, so long as:
* The code is open source.
* You give proper credit by including a comment in your code with a URL or clear description of the source code. Credit is also required for “adapted” code.
* The copied/adapted code cannot make up a substantial portion of the project.

**Instructables**  
If you find a project online that you’d like to replicate, think about how you can make it your own. Using online projects for inspiration is permissible; copying projects directly is not. Talk to Ms. deBB if you have any questions.
